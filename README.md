I'm a passionate and self-driven Python-Django developer with a solid foundation in computer science and practical experience in backend development, databases, and system integration. My journey blends software with hardware innovation—from crafting web apps to building real-time data systems using Arduino and RGB LEDs.

During my academic years, I led a thesis on **Li-Fi-based Parallel Data Transmission**, utilizing RGB color encoding for high-efficiency communication—a perfect example of my love for blending logic, electronics, and code.
